# Library Epitech
This repository contains all the function from my lib C I used during all my first year at Epitech.  
This repositoy does'nt contain all the function from the first year Piscine (because some of them are useless).  
All functions are in accordance with Epitech's coding style.  
In order to avoid relinking, the Makefile copies all the objects files in the `obj` folder when compiling, the fclean rule will also delete this directory.
